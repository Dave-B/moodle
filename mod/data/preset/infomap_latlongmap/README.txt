== Quick start ==

1. You also need these plugins:
 * local_map (provides a map API)
 * "latlongmap" database field (a copy of latlong, with added maps)

2. Place the unzipped "infomap" directory in [site_root]/mod/data/preset/

3. Visit [site_root]/admin and install the three plugins (local/maps, latlongmap field, infomap preset).

4. Create a database activity from the "Infomap" preset; customise and enjoy!

Have fun!

== Documentation ==

See local_map README.txt
